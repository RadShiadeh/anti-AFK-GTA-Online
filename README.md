A script I wrote so I don't get kicked off a closed online session based on a similar Python script found in the thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489013/simulate-python-keypresses-for-controlling-a-game which you can also find in this repo

It randomly moves the character forward and wiggles the mouse

Every IRL hour it calls Mutt to source supplies, which can only happen twice per run

if using this, only use it in a closed friends session, make sure Mutt can be called and is not always busy (happens sometimes when you spawn in, going outside of your spawn location works)

make sure the key mappings are correct: you need to change your key binds as I couldn't make the arrow keys work... up: i, down: k, left: j, and right: l... change these binds in settings for your phone
